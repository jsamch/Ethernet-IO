Version Information:

-----------------------------------
alpha

DACSimpleTest.py

  Can drive the DACs in -10V to +10V mode.  
  The class accepts the voltages as floats.

  The example is a very basic demo of the DACs operation.  The demonstration 
  client software will be refined, but the DAC class will likely remain 
  stable.
